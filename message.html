          <p><img src="images/pcmn.png" width="170" /> <b>Dr. Anil Rattan Verma</b><br/>Principal Govt. College<br/> Tissa HP -176316</p>
          <p><br/> It gives me immense pleasure to dedicate the web-site of this college to our talented, energetic and enterprising students, who have made commendable contribution in the growth of Govt. College, Tissa in academics, sports and co-curricular activities.
                                Life of the students of this college, which is located in a far-off and tough terrain, is a real challenge. Here one hardly gets proper avenues or opportunities to show one’s talent due to various reasons, including one’s inhibitions and one’s psychological barriers. I am pleased to place on record that despite these obstacles and deficiencies our students are not far behind their counterparts in other colleges. Our student, Reeta Kumari’s rare feat of securing sixth rank in the H.P. UNIVERSITY MERIT LIST OF B.A. (PASS COURSE) FOR THE SESSION 2014-15 proves this point beyond doubt. Her persistent hard work, tremendous focus, perseverance and zeal to excel have made Govt. College, Tissa, its Principal, teaching faculty and other staff and the people of Churah, proud. 
                               Education is always regarded as the most important parameter of development of a country. A College provides a platform where the destiny of the nation is shaped by channelizing the energy of youth towards the desired end. The future of our economy depends upon the way we groom our students and provide them suitable environment for various academics, sports and co-curricular activities.
                                I feel honored in underlying the fact that Govt. College, Tissa is a frontrunner among the colleges of Himachal Pradesh and provides quality education to its students through traditional and modern hi-tech equipments installed here.
                                Finally, I congratulate the students, teaching and non-teaching staff for their disciplined approach, dedication, hard work, and above all their unstinting co-operation in managing the various affairs of the college.<br/></p>
